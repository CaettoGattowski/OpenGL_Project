This is an openGL project where i showcase a full series of commits that resolve around me learning about the openGL libraries of GLEW,GLFW and SDL, firstly how to set them up.
Secondly I use the rendering pipeling to create with shaders my first triangle and then set up the GLM openGL Maths Library to learn about the transformations of Translation, Rotation and Scaling.
I then used Interpolation and Indexed Draws with projections and I continued with the camera set up to be moved when keys are pressed but also control it with mouse movements adding in the end 
two triangles. Later I researched about texture and image loading where I added the textures of brick and dirt on the two triangles as show in picture 1. Afterwards I go on using Ambient Lighting
to dim a red coloured directional lighting to the two triangles as shown in picture 2.

I proceed in adding directional diffuse lightning as shown in the following pictures but with the difference that picture 3 has phong shading whereas picture 4 has flat shading.

Added Specular Lighting on both triangles one with dull one with shiny material as shown in picture 5.
