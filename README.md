This is an openGL project where i showcase a full series of commits that resolve around me learning about the openGL libraries of GLEW,GLFW and SDL, firstly how to set them up.
Secondly I use the rendering pipeling to create with shaders my first triangle and then set up the GLM openGL Maths Library to learn about the transformations of Translation, Rotation and Scaling.
I then used Interpolation and Indexed Draws with projections and I continued with the camera set up to be moved when keys are pressed but also control it with mouse movements adding in the end 
two triangles. Later I researched about texture and image loading where I added the textures of brick and dirt on the two triangles as show in picture 1. Afterwards I go on using Ambient Lighting
to dim a red coloured directional lighting to the two triangles as shown in picture 2.

I proceed in adding directional diffuse lightning as shown in the following pictures but with the difference that picture 3 has phong shading whereas picture 4 has flat shading.

Added Specular Lighting on both triangles one with dull one with shiny material as shown in picture 5.

Added two different point Lights, green and blue that shine on the two triangle pyramids and the floor as seen on picture 6. The shininess can be seen on picture 7.

Added a flashlight camera based position and direction that changes depending the depth as shown in pictures 8 and 9.
